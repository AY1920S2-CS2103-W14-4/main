== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the CoderLifeInsights data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the CoderLifeInsights data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.coderlifeinsights.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::importexport[]
=== Import feature
==== Implementation

The import feature allows users to import data from a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
It allows users to bulk import their contacts from a previously exported data from CoderLifeInsights application.

Given below is the sequence diagram shows how the import operation works with the command `import life.csv`:

.Interaction for `import` Command operation between Logic Component and Model Component.
[#ImportFileSequenceDiagram,align="center"]
image::ImportFileSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following is a brief explanation of <<ImportFileSequenceDiagram>> :

1. User enters `import life.csv`.
2. `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` is being called by `LogicManager`.
3. This would create `ImportCommand` and checks if the input is valid.
4. Feedback would be returned to `AddressBookParser` and then to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` would then call `execute()` and creates `ImportFile`.
6. `ImportFile` would then call `importCsv()` to return a `List<Person>`.
7. `Model#importCsvToAddressBook(importedPeople)` is then being called by `LogicManager`
passing on `List<Person>` to call `VersionedAddressBook#addPersons(importedPeople)`
8. `VersionedAddressBook` would call the method `addAll` and populate the data accordingly.
9. On successful import with no duplicates of person, it would return a success message to `LogicManager`

The following is an activity diagram when a user executes the import command:

.Import feature activity diagram.
[#ImportFileActivityDiagram,align="center"]
image::ImportFileActivityDiagram.png[]

When a user executes the `import` command, a parser would check if the CSV is valid or not. That means it would check
if the CSV file exists within the specified file path and whether the CSV file is valid for import in the application's
directory.

If valid, the rows in the CSV file would then parsed and then creates a list of person to be imported.

Following that, the list would then update the current data and saves into the CoderLifeInsights.

The following class diagram illustrates the summary of the ImportFile class.

.Import feature class diagram.
[#ImportFileClassDiagram,align="center"]
image::ImportFileClassDiagram.png[][pdfwidth="30%",width="30%"]
==== Csv file format and constraints
In order for data to be imported into CoderLifeInsights, the CSV file provided must be in the exact format.
There are 9 columns specified for `name`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `tagged`, `time`, `places` , `activities` and
=== Export feature
==== Implementation

The export feature allows users to export their current data into a comma-separated value file with file name specified.

Given below is the sequence diagram illustrates how the export operation works with the command `export life.csv`:
.Interaction for `export` Command operation between Logic Component and Model Component.
[#ExportFileSequenceDiagram,align="center"]
image::ExportFileSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following is an activity diagram when a user executes the export command:

1. User enters `export life.csv`
2. `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` is being called by `LogicManager`.
3. This would create `ExportCommand` and checks if the input is valid.
4. Feedback would be returned to `AddressBookParser` and then to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` would then call `execute()` and creates `ExportFile`.
6. `ExportFile` would then call `exportCsv()` with `Model#getAddressBookFilePath()` to return the current address
book's file path.
7. On successful export, it would return a success message to `LogicManager`.


The following is an activity diagram when a user executes the export command:

.Export feature activity diagram.
[#ExportFileActivityDiagram,align="center"]
image::ExportFileActivityDiagram.png[][pdfwidth="60%",width="60%"]

When a user executes `export` command, a parser would check if the CSV file name is valid.

If valid, it would then proceed to export the current JSON data to the application's directory with the
CSV file name provided.

The following class diagram illustrates the summary of the ExportFile class.

//end::importexport[]

=== Add Group Feature
==== Implementation

The `add_group` feature is implemented to allow users to track social activities with a group of people
(instead of just one person). The feature is mainly supported by the `AddGroupCommand` class, which extends the abstract
class `Command` and `AddGroupCommandParser`, which implements the `Parser` interface. The command creates a new `Group` instance, which is then stored in an instance of `UniqueGroupList`, which
in turn is stored in the `AddressBook`.

The following class diagram showcases the relationship between the main classes that support this command:



Here below is a sequence diagram showcasing the process of this command.

==== Design Considerations


=== Delete Group Feature
==== Implementation

[#DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram, align="center"]
image::DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.png[]


//tag::list_group[]
=== List Group Feature
==== Implementation

The list feature allows users to view all the social groups currently in Coder Life Insights.

Here below is a sequence diagram showcasing how the command works.

[#ListGroupSequenceDiagram, align="center"]
image::ListGroupSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram depicts the step-by-step scenario when a user executes the `list_groups` command:

1. User enters `list_groups` into the command prompt
2. The `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`
3. The method `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` creates a `ListGroupCommand` and checks if the input is valid.
4. The `ListGroupCommand` calls the `updateFilteredGroupList` method of `Model` to update the GUI.
5. The `ListGroupCommand` returns the `CommandResult` to AddressBookParser
6. The `AddressBookParser` returns the `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.

=== Edit Group Feature

==== Implementation

[#EditGroupSequenceDiagram, align="center"]
image::EditGroupSequenceDiagram.png[]



//end::edit_group[]
//tag::addEvent[]
=== Add Event Feature
The add event feature allows users to add an event to a saved contact or group in CoderLifeInsights specified
using the member `m/` tag or the group `g/` prefix.

==== Implementation
Command: `add_event ACTIVITY m/INDEX time/TIME place/PLACE` or `add_event ACTIVITY g/INDEX time/TIME place/PLACE`

Remarks:

* TIME is the variable used to store the time the user has spent with a saved contact or group.
* TIME parameter must contain at least 2 digits. For example: A time of 1 hour and 30 minutes will be input as `130`.
* An event added must have time of at least 1 minute. e.g. time/01
* Place and Activity are case-sensitive

Example usage: `add_event date night m/1 time/230 place/Gardens by the Bay`

The command above will add the following to the Person whose index is `1` on the filtered or unfiltered list:

* Activity `date night` into the Person's activityList.
* Place `Gardens by the Bay` into the Person's placeList.
* Time `230` which equals 2 hours and 30 minutes, will be added to the Person's time.

It will also create an Event with the following attributes:
* Activity: `date night`
* Place: `Gardens by the Bay`
* Time: `2h 30m`

Depicted below is the class diagram of the Event class:

image::EventClassDiagram.png[]
The Event created is stored in an UniqueEventList, which is saved to the Json file as well. The Events saved are used to generate output for features.

The sequence diagram below showcases how the command works with a valid input:

image::addEventSequence.png[pdfwidth="100%", width="92.5%"]

The following class diagram shows how the Time, PlaceList and ActivityList are associated with a Person object:

image::addEventClassDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram depicts the following scenario:

1. User enters `add_event date night m/1 time/230 place/Gardens by the Bay` into the command prompt.
2. The `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
3. The method `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` creates a `AddEventCommandParser` and calls the `AddEventCommandParser#parse()` method.
4. `AddEventCommandParser#parse()` checks if input is valid.
5. `AddEventCommandParser#parse()` then creates a new instance of `AddEventCommand`.
6. `AddEventCommand` calls the `AddEventCommand#execute()` method.
7. `AddEventCommand#execute()` retrieves the filtered list with the call to `model#getFilteredPersonList()`.
8. `AddEventCommand#execute()` then retrieves the Person object to be edited with the call to `model#getFilteredPersonList()#get()`.
9. `AddEventCommand#execute()` then computes the new Time by retrieving the Person's current Time with the call to `person#getTime()` ,then adding it to the input Time.
10. `AddEventCommand#execute()` then creates a new ActivityList by retrieving the Person's ActivityList with the call to `person#getActivityList2()`, followed by `ActivityList#addActivity()`, which returns a new ActivityList with the new activity added.
11. `AddEventCommand#execute()` then creates a new PlaceList by retrieving the Person's PlaceList with the call to `person#getPlaceList2()`, followed by `PlaceList#addPlace()`, which returns a new PlaceList with the new place added.
12. `AddEventCommand#execute()` then creates a new Person object with all the same attributes except for the Time, PlaceList, and ActivityList which is replaced by the new Time computed, the new PlaceList and the new ActivityList with the call to the Person constructor.
13. `AddEventCommand#execute()` then replaces the existing Person object with the new Person object with the call to `model#setPerson()`.
14. `AddEventCommand#execute()` then updates the filtered list with the call to `model#updateFilteredPersonList()`.
15. `AddEventCommand` returns the `CommandResult` to `AddressBookParser`.
16. `AddressBookParser` returns the `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.

image::addEventActivity.png[pdfwidth="100%", width="75%"]

==== Justification
The Add Event feature and the relevant classes were added and implemented to add and store Events with relevant data that are used to generate output for other features such as insights.


//end::addEvent[]

=== Insights feature
==== Implementation

The Insights feature is facilitated by `FrequencyList`, which contains an `ObservableList`
backed by an `ArrayList`, and uses a `HashMap` to ensure the uniqueness of each list.
Each `Person` object contains two `FrequencyList` objects, a `placeList` and an `activityList`.
At the same time, the `model` also has its own `FrequencyList`. When the View Command is
activated, the `model` updates its own `FrequencyList` with the contents of the selected
Person's `placeList` or `activityList`. The View Command then switches the application
display to show the model's `FrequencyList`.

=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and
`currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current CoderLifeInsights state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous CoderLifeInsights state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone CoderLifeInsights state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial CoderLifeInsights state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single CoderLifeInsights state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the CoderLifeInsights. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the CoderLifeInsights after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified CoderLifeInsights state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the CoderLifeInsights state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous CoderLifeInsights state, and restores the CoderLifeInsights to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial CoderLifeInsights state, then there are no previous CoderLifeInsights states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the CoderLifeInsights to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CoderLifeInsights state, then there are no undone CoderLifeInsights states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the CoderLifeInsights, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all CoderLifeInsights states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CoderLifeInsights.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of CoderLifeInsights states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
