<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coder Life Insights is a social application that helps users keep track of their friends and the time spent with them.
Optimized for users who prefer using the command line interface, the main intended beneficiaries of this app
are computing professionals and students, who could use regular reminders to take some time away from the screen
to share with their friends.</p>

<h2 id="my-role"><a class="link" href="#my-role">My Role</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this project, I was assigned the implementation of Coder Life Insights’ eponymous Insights function,
which allows users to view various kinds of insights about the persons, groups and events that they have added
and stored on the application. While it is one independent feature, it is made up of several sub-features,
each having their own keywords and functions. With these functions, users can see a list of places they have visited
or activities they have done with selected persons or groups, ranked by their frequencies. Users can also view
their 5 most recently added events, whether with a particular person or group, or overall.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having implemented this function, I was mainly responsible for the documentation of this feature,
and updated the corresponding sections of the User Guide and Developer Guide accordingly.
To illustrate its implementation, I designed the following three UML diagrams:
•	View Command Generic Sequence Diagram
•	View Command Condensed Generic Sequence Diagram
•	View Command Class Diagram</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On top of my own features, I also contributed to common sections of the Developer Guide,
updating the original architecture diagram for the app’s UI component to reflect its new features, as well as its explanation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementation-wise, being responsible for the ‘view’ function, I helped my team to build the foundations for the UI implementation,
by coming up with the design of having the MainWindow UI controller switch between different view panels based on
a ViewType variable input from the CommandResult. Correspondingly, I also got us started with the first few GUI display panels (.fxml files).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have also been diligent in analyzing the team’s code for bugs and deficiencies in system design to ensure that we continue
to have a clear code base to build off. Nonetheless, I must acknowledge that I have not had enough consistent time to put
into this project, and my teammates have definitely contributed more than me to the shared components of this project,
and its overall direction.</p>
